## About Ren'Py Editor

This app is designed to automatize the coding process.
You can add characters, backgrounds, musics... then combinate them to make scenes.
When you have a lot of scenes, you can chain them with actions.
When you have finished your story, export the script to Ren'Py and enjoy your visual novel.
